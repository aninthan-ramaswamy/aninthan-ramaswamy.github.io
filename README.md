Thank you for visiting the page. It may be fruitful to delve into some quick introduction.

My name is Aninthan and I consider myself a data-sciences professional. The main purpose of creating this site is to host a portfolio of what I have learnt, and (hopefully!) consistently update them as and when I learn. My career has been kind to me, and I have helped businesses put the data they have generated/acquired to good use - be it through simple data querying, or BI reporting, or statistical learning (through math models) - in figuring out solutions for pressing business problems. Usually, I am involved in designing and translating the solutions to business users. Coding, reporting, and a lot of presentations.
